# Due Diligence Reporter — Roadmap

## Status: Active Development

Last updated: 03/12/2026

---

## Completed

- [x] Initial MCP server implementation (4 tools: get_site_record, list_drive_documents, read_drive_document, create_dd_report)
- [x] E-Occupancy + School Approval skills embedded in prompt.md
- [x] Google Doc template with {{placeholder}} tokens
- [x] CI/CD deploy to MCP Hive via GitHub Actions
- [x] First report generated: Alpha Brentwood 307 (02/27/2026)
- [x] Quality fixes from first report review (commit 9b0ebf7):
  - Skill → schema field mappings in prompt.md
  - Exec summary must-be-in-report_data rule
  - Q4 milestone formulas (CO/Ready-to-Open = N/A in preliminary)
  - ISP fallback (`[Pending ISP]` when no ISP doc exists)
  - List formatting rule (newline-separated strings)
  - 6 q4.*_confidence fields added to schema
  - utils.py list join `", "` → `"\n"`
- [x] **Wrike stage + status filtering (03/12/2026):**
  - Daily cron and inbox scanner pipeline phase now filter by Wrike active status group and stages 1–2
  - `_get_active_status_ids()` fetches workflow metadata to resolve active `customStatusId` values
  - Records without a `customStatusId` default to active (safe fallback)
- [x] **Tiered LLM document classification (03/12/2026):**
  - New `classifier.py` module: Tier 1 (regex keywords) → Tier 2 (GPT-4o-mini on filename) → Tier 3 (GPT-4o-mini on first-page PDF content)
  - LLM site-matching for shared folders: `match_file_to_site_llm()` handles non-standard filenames
  - Graceful degradation — falls back to regex-only if OpenAI is unavailable
  - Validated: correctly classified `zoning proof email chain.pdf` as SIR via Tier 3 content analysis
- [x] **Recursive folder search (03/12/2026):**
  - New `GoogleClient.list_files_recursive()` walks subfolders up to configurable depth
  - Replaced hardcoded `01_Due Diligence` subfolder with recursive search (max depth 2)
  - Older sites with non-standard folder structures are now fully searched
- [x] **P1 Accountable email fix (03/12/2026):**
  - `extract_p1_email_from_record()` now handles both string and list contact ID values
  - Added logging for P1 field resolution (field value, type, resolved email)
  - Validated: Bethesda P1 resolved to `robbie.forrest@trilogy.com`
- [x] **Email recipient update (03/12/2026):**
  - `DD_REPORT_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` secret updated to `jc.fischer@trilogy.com,auth.permitting@trilogy.com`
  - P1 Accountable person added to DD report emails automatically
- [x] **Inbox scan window extended (03/12/2026):**
  - Expanded from 8AM–6PM to 6AM–8PM Central, Mon–Fri
  - Split into two cron entries to avoid GitHub Actions parsing issues
- [x] **Daily DD check site filter (03/12/2026):**
  - Added `--site` input to workflow_dispatch for targeted manual runs

## In Progress

### 1. Exec Summary Validation
**Problem:** First report had exec_summary fields left as `{{exec_summary.*}}` tokens — agent wrote the summary in chat but didn't include it in report_data before calling create_dd_report.
**Fix applied:** Added IMPORTANT rule to prompt.md.
**Needs:** Run a test report and confirm all 5 exec_summary fields land in the doc.

### 2. Skill Execution Audit
**Problem:** Agent may be acknowledging the embedded skills without running through the scoring logic step by step (approximating rather than computing).
**Suspicion:** Skills are embedded as text in prompt.md — agent could be skipping or summarizing them, especially if context is long.
**Options to investigate:**
- Option A: Keep embedded in prompt.md but add explicit "show your work" instructions before calling create_dd_report
- Option B: Convert each skill to an MCP tool call (`apply_e_occupancy_skill(building_type, stories)` → returns score/zone/tier/timeline) — forces explicit invocation and returns structured output
- Option C: Add a `read_skill_file(skill_name)` tool so the agent reads the skill on demand (lazy load vs. always in context)

### 3. Building Optimizer Integration
**Goal:** Populate Q3 cost estimates programmatically from the Building Optimizer instead of relying on a manual ISP document.
**Unknown:** What form is the Building Optimizer? (MCP server / REST API / Google Sheet / internal tool)
**Next step:** Clarify with user, then design integration approach.

## Backlog

- [ ] Template docx: manually add `{{q4.*_confidence}}` tokens to confidence column in Q4 schedule table, re-upload to Drive
- [ ] Renderings section: agent currently skips `renderings_links` — needs guidance on where renderings live in Drive
- [ ] Multi-site batch mode: run DD reports for a list of sites in one agent session
- [ ] LiDAR data extraction: `lidar_summary` and `as_built_links` often left as [TBD]

## Known Issues

| Issue | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Confidence column in Q4 table has hardcoded "M" not tokens | Confidence values not replaced | Manual docx edit needed (add `{{q4.*_confidence}}` tokens) |
| exec_summary may still land in chat not doc | Report lacks executive summary | Prompt fix deployed; needs validation |
| Skills may be approximated not computed | Inaccurate scores | Under investigation |

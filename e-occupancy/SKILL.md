# E Occupancy Conversion Evaluator

Evaluate commercial properties for conversion to E occupancy (K-12 schools). Score based on current building type, floor position, and conversion complexity.

## Overview

This skill:
1. Researches the property using web search to determine current use/occupancy
2. Checks for floor-level vs. whole-building evaluation
3. Looks up building type in `scoring_matrix.json`
4. Applies tenant space deductions if evaluating a specific floor/suite
5. Returns a score (0-1) based on conversion complexity

**Reference Data**: `scoring_matrix.json` (in this skill folder)

## Scoring System

| Score | Rating | Meaning | Timeline |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| **100** | GREEN | Current K-12 school with E occupancy | Ready to proceed |
| **95** | YELLOW | Daycare (E occupancy, needs school code upgrade) | 3-6 months |
| **90-94** | YELLOW | Very easy conversion | 3-6 months |
| **70-89** | YELLOW | Easy to moderate | 6-9 months |
| **50-69** | YELLOW | Moderate complexity | 9-12 months |
| **30-49** | YELLOW | Complex conversion | 12-18 months |
| **15-29** | YELLOW | Very complex | 18-24+ months |
| **1-14** | YELLOW | Extremely difficult | 24+ months |
| **0** | RED | Do not pursue | N/A |

**CRITICAL**: Score 100 = GREEN, Scores 1-99 = ALL YELLOW, Score 0 = RED

**Higher score = Easier conversion**

### Scoring Weights

Scores are based on weighted conversion complexity:
- **40%** Building type complexity (code path, conversion precedents)
- **30%** Systems modifications (HVAC, plumbing, electrical)
- **20%** Structural requirements (fire/life safety, egress, ADA)
- **10%** Size and scale (square footage, stories)

## Part 1: Research the Property

Use web search to determine:
1. Current occupancy classification (E, B, A-1, A-2, A-3, S-1, etc.)
2. Current business/use type
3. Building characteristics (stories, size)
4. Floor/suite being evaluated (if applicable)

### Search Queries

```
[county] property appraiser [address]
[county] assessor [address]
[city] certificate of occupancy [address]
"[address]" business
site:loopnet.com "[address]"
```

### Key Information to Extract

- **Current occupancy**: E (educational), B (business), A (assembly), S (storage), etc.
- **Building type**: Office, retail, church, warehouse, etc.
- **Stories**: Total building height (1-3, 4-6, or 7+)
- **Floor/Suite**: If address includes "Floor X" or "Suite XXX"
- **Current tenant/use**: School, daycare, office, gym, restaurant, etc.

### Occupancy Classifications (IBC)

- **E**: Educational (schools K-12, daycare >5 children)
- **B**: Business (offices, medical offices, retail)
- **A-1**: Assembly - Fixed Seating (theaters, auditoriums)
- **A-2**: Assembly - Food/Drink (restaurants, bars, nightclubs)
- **A-3**: Assembly - Worship/Recreation (churches, gyms)
- **I-1**: Institutional - Assisted (assisted living)
- **I-2**: Institutional - Medical (hospitals, nursing homes)
- **S-1**: Storage - Moderate Hazard (warehouses)
- **F-1**: Factory - Moderate Hazard (manufacturing)

## Part 3: Height Triggers

Height overrides building type score:

| Stories | Score Ceiling |
|---------|---------------|
| 1-3 | No ceiling |
| 4-6 | 42 (max) |
| 7+ | 20 (max) |

**Example**: 26-story office = Score 20 (high-rise), NOT 82 (office)

**CRITICAL**: E occupancy above 3rd floor triggers significant fire/life safety upgrades.

---

## Part 4: Floor-Level Evaluations (Tenant Spaces)

**CRITICAL**: When an address specifies a floor number or suite (e.g., "Floor 2", "Suite 200"), you are evaluating a TENANT SPACE, NOT the entire building.

### Step 1: Identify Floor Number

Parse address for floor indicators:
- "Floor 2", "2nd Floor", "Fl 2"
- "Suite 200" (typically 2nd floor)
- If no floor specified, assume entire building

### Step 2: Check Floor vs. 3rd Floor Threshold

**E occupancy above 3rd floor triggers significant code requirements.**

| Floor Position | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| **Floors 1-3** | Do NOT apply high-rise penalties. Use base building type score. |
| **Floors 4+** | Apply high-rise complexity modifiers (Score 42 or 20 ceiling) |

### Step 3: Determine Base Score

Start with underlying building type:
- Office tenant space → Base 82
- Retail ground floor → Base 75-85
- Medical office suite → Base 75
- Church in multi-tenant → Base 78

### Step 4: Apply Tenant Space Deductions

**Deduct points for shared building constraints:**

| Constraint | Deduction |
|------------|-----------|
| Shared HVAC system with rest of building | -5 |
| Shared egress/elevators (no dedicated entrance) | -5 |
| Building management/landlord approval required | -5 |
| No dedicated entrance from street level | -5 |
| No access to outdoor space | -5 |
| Shared parking (no dedicated school parking) | -3 |
| Mixed-use building with incompatible tenants | -5 |

**Maximum total deduction**: -30 points
**Minimum final score**: 1 (cannot go below 1 unless environmental)

### Step 5: Calculate Final Score

```
Final Score = Base Building Type Score - Sum of Applicable Deductions
Final Score = max(Final Score, 1)  # Cannot go below 1
```

### Floor-Level Examples

**Example 1: Office Floor 2 in 26-story High-Rise**
```
Address: 515 Congress Ave, Floor 2, Austin, TX
Building: 26-story office tower
Floor: 2 (below 3rd floor trigger ✓)

Base score: 82 (office general)
Deductions:
  - Shared HVAC: -5
  - Shared egress: -5
  - Building approval: -5
  - No dedicated entrance: -5
  - No outdoor access: -5
Total deductions: -25

Final Score: 82 - 25 = 57 (Moderate complexity)
Rating: YELLOW
Timeline: 9-12 months
```

**Example 2: Office Floor 8 in High-Rise**
```
Address: 515 Congress Ave, Floor 8, Austin, TX
Building: 26-story office tower
Floor: 8 (ABOVE 3rd floor trigger ❌)

Base score: 20 (high-rise 7+ stories applies because floor > 3)
No additional deductions (high-rise score already accounts for complexity)

Final Score: 20 (Very complex)
Rating: YELLOW
Timeline: 18-24+ months
```

**Example 3: Ground Floor Retail**
```
Address: 123 Main St, Suite 101, Dallas, TX
Building: 3-story mixed-use
Floor: 1 (ground level ✓)

Base score: 85 (retail strip individual)
Deductions:
  - Shared HVAC: -5
  - Mixed-use tenants above: -5
  - Shared parking: -3
Total deductions: -13

Final Score: 85 - 13 = 72 (Easy to moderate)
Rating: YELLOW
Timeline: 6-9 months
```

## Part 5: Confidence Assessment

### HIGH Confidence
- Occupancy confirmed via official records (building permits, certificates)
- Current use clearly identified from multiple sources
- Building specs verified through county assessor
- Score assignment is unambiguous

### MEDIUM Confidence
- Occupancy inferred from typical use (e.g., office = B occupancy)
- Current tenant confirmed but limited building detail
- Single primary data source
- Score assignment based on keywords match

### LOW Confidence
- Limited data available
- Occupancy assumed without verification
- Current use unclear or conflicting information
- Vacant or "for lease" status with unclear history

---

## Part 6: Common Edge Cases

### Vacant Properties
- Note previous tenant if determinable
- Check "for lease" listings for use history
- **Reduce score by 5-10 points** if previous use unknown
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM or LOW

### Mixed-Use Buildings
- Evaluate based on specific unit's use
- Note shared egress considerations
- Consider incompatible neighboring tenants
- May need separate evaluations for different sections

### Former Schools
- **Score 100** if still has E occupancy
- Variable if occupancy changed - check certificate validity
- Excellent candidate even if currently different use

### Unknown Occupancy
- State: "Unknown - assumed [X] based on use"
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM or LOW

---

## Part 7: Scoring for Building Suitability

Convert score to 0-1 scale for the parent skill:

### Conversion Formula

```
occupancy_score = score_0_100 / 100
```

### Examples

| Building Type | score_0_100 | occupancy_score (0-1) |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Current school (E occupancy) | 100 | 1.00 |
| 2-story office | 92 | 0.92 |
| Floor 2 office (tenant space) | 57 | 0.57 |
| Small church | 78 | 0.78 |
| 5-story office (entire building) | 42 | 0.42 |
| Restaurant | 12 | 0.12 |
| Gas station | 0 | 0.00 |

### Output for Parent Skill

Return to `alpha-building-suitability`:
- `occupancy_score`: 0-1 score (score_0_100 / 100)
- `zone`: GREEN / YELLOW / RED
- `building_type`: identified type
- `floor_level`: floor being evaluated (if applicable)
- `confidence`: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- `timeline`: estimated conversion timeline

## Quick Decision Tree

```
1. Current K-12 school with E occupancy? → Score 100 (GREEN) ✅

2. Daycare with E occupancy? → Score 95 (YELLOW)

3. Environmental contamination? → Score 0 (RED) 🛑
   (gas station, dry cleaner, auto body, etc.)

4. Is this a tenant space (floor/suite specified)?
   YES → Go to Step 5
   NO → Go to Step 6

5. Tenant space evaluation:
   a. What floor?
      - Floors 1-3: Use base building type score
      - Floors 4+: Apply high-rise ceiling (42 or 20)
   b. Apply tenant space deductions (-5 to -30)
   c. Final = max(Base - Deductions, 1)

6. Whole building evaluation:
   a. Match building type → Get base score
   b. Check height ceiling:
      - 7+ stories → ceiling 20
      - 4-6 stories → ceiling 42
      - 1-3 stories → no ceiling
   c. Final = min(Base Score, Height Ceiling)
```

## Key Rules

1. **Score 100 = Current K-12 school with E occupancy** (GREEN)
2. **Score 95 = Daycare with E occupancy** (YELLOW - needs school code upgrade)
3. **Scores 1-99 = ALL YELLOW** (conversion needed, higher = easier)
4. **Score 0 = Environmental contamination ONLY** (RED)
5. **Height overrides type** - use most restrictive
6. **Floor 2 of high-rise ≠ entire building** - evaluate the specific floor
7. **3rd floor is critical threshold** - E occupancy above 3rd triggers upgrades
8. **Apply tenant space deductions** when evaluating floors/suites
9. **Restaurants & Banks are YELLOW** (scores 12 and 15) - not RED

## Notes

- Size is irrelevant: Schools operate from 3k SF (microschools) to 150k SF (full campuses)
- This skill does NOT write to the database
- Score is returned to the parent `alpha-building-suitability` skill
- The parent skill combines this with other sub-scores for the final `building_score`

# Due Diligence Reporter — How It Works

**Version:** 4.0.0
**Team:** EDU Ops Intelligence
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-20

---

## Overview

The Due Diligence Reporter is an AI agent powered by Claude that generates Site Due Diligence (DD) Reports for potential Alpha School locations. It operates in three modes:

1. **Interactive** — A human gives it a site name in chat via MCP Hive. The agent gathers data, runs analytical skills, and produces an executive-ready Google Doc.
2. **Event-Driven (Inbox Scan — every 15 min)** — A scheduled script scans the `edu.ops@trilogy.com` inbox for new SIR and Building Inspection PDFs, classifies them with GPT-5.2, uploads to the correct shared Drive folder, then immediately checks if the site is ready for report generation.
3. **Daily Sweep (Safety Net — 9 AM)** — A scheduled script scans all Wrike Site Records in active DD stages. When a site has all three required documents (SIR, ISP, Building Inspection) and no existing report, it triggers full report generation. This catches anything the 15-min scan missed.

The agent gathers facts. It does not make recommendations. The decision belongs to the leadership team.

## The V2 Report

The V2 DD Report is a **structured executive one-pager** — not the multi-page narrative of V1. It uses structured checklists, pick-menu dimensions, and bare values instead of prose paragraphs.

**28 template tokens** across three sections:

| Section | Count | What it covers |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **meta** | 7 | Site name, address, school type, marketing name, report date, prepared by, Drive folder link |
| **exec** | 15 | "Can we do this?" card (4 pick-menu dimensions), cost/capacity/timeline grid (6 values + 3 server-computed deltas), lease conditions, risk notes |
| **sources** | 6 | Links to SIR, Building Inspection, ISP, E-Occupancy Assessment, School Approval Assessment, Report Trace |

### "Can we do this?" card

Four dimensions, each a fixed pick-menu:

| Dimension | Source | Options |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `exec.c_answer` | Agent synthesis | YES / NO / CONDITIONAL |
| `exec.c_zoning` | SIR | Permitted by right / Use Permit Required (Admin) / Use Permit Required (Public) / Prohibited |
| `exec.c_occupancy` | E-Occupancy skill | Has E-Occupancy / Change of use required, meets E-Occupancy / Change of use required, needs work |
| `exec.c_edreg` | School Approval skill | Not required / Required and have done / Required have not done |

### Cost / Capacity / Timeline grid

Two tiers (MVP and Ideal) with server-computed deltas:

| Row | MVP token | Ideal token | Delta (auto-computed) |
|-----|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Capacity | `exec.e_mvp_capacity` | `exec.e_ideal_capacity` | `exec.delta_capacity` |
| Cost | `exec.e_mvp_cost` | `exec.e_ideal_cost` | `exec.delta_cost` |
| Timeline | `exec.f_mvp_ready` | `exec.f_ideal_ready` | `exec.delta_ready` |

Rules: cost = single midpoint number (not a range), timeline = MM/YY format only, Wrike comments override API numbers.

### Conditions and Risk Notes

Two separate tokens with distinct classification rules:

| Token | Purpose | Classification test |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `exec.acquisition_conditions` | Contractual items for the lease/purchase agreement | "Would we walk away if this were not addressed before signing?" |
| `exec.risk_notes` | Informational flags for budgeting/planning | "Is this something we'll handle during buildout or budget for?" |

Both require per-bullet source citations.

## Inbox Scanner — Event-Driven Pipeline

**Script:** `scripts/scan_inbox.py`
**Module:** `src/due_diligence_reporter/inbox_scanner.py`
**Schedule:** Every 15 minutes, 6 AM–8 PM Central, Monday–Friday
**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/inbox-scan.yml`

The inbox scanner is the primary trigger for report generation. When a vendor emails a SIR or Building Inspection to `edu.ops@trilogy.com`, the scanner picks it up within 15 minutes.

### Phase 1 — Scan, Classify, Upload

```
For each unprocessed email with PDF attachments:
  1. Extract email metadata (subject, sender, body snippet, attachments)
  2. Classify each PDF with GPT-5.2:
     - doc_type: "sir", "building_inspection", or "unknown"
     - matched_site_id: which Wrike site record this belongs to
     - confidence: 0.0–1.0
  3. If confidence >= 0.7 and doc_type is supported:
     a. Generate standardized filename (e.g., "Mar 03 2026 - Alpha Keller SIR.pdf")
     b. Check for duplicates in target shared folder
     c. Upload to correct shared Drive folder (SIR → SIR folder, BI → BI folder)
  4. If confidence < 0.7 → flag for manual review in Google Chat
  5. Mark email as processed (DD-Processed label)
```

**Building Inspection naming convention:** Reports are titled `[Brand] [City] Building Inspection Report` (e.g., "Alpha Keller Building Inspection Report"), which helps GPT-5.2 match them to the correct site record.

**Supported doc types:** `sir`, `building_inspection`. ISPs arrive through a separate channel and are placed manually.

### Phase 2 — Per-Site Pipeline

After all uploads complete, the scanner identifies which sites received new documents and runs the report pipeline for each:

```
For each unique site that received an upload:
  1. Look up Wrike record → get Drive folder URL → build match terms
  2. Refresh shared folder cache (picks up just-uploaded files)
  3. Run process_site_pipeline():
     a. Check readiness (SIR + ISP + Inspection present?)
     b. If missing docs → post Google Chat alert with checklist
     c. If report exists → skip
     d. If ready → trigger Claude agent loop → check completeness → email
  4. Post result to Google Chat
```

**Flags:**
- `--scan-only` — Run Phase 1 only (inbox scan), skip the pipeline
- `--dry-run` — Classify and match without uploading or marking emails

---

## Document Detection — Three-Tier Strategy

The system must find three source documents before generating a report. Documents can live in two places.

### Primary: Shared Drive Folders

Three shared folders hold documents across all sites:

| Doc Type | Folder | Config Key |
|----------|--------|------------|
| SIR (Site Investigation Report) | `1TTjxOEfjeJZoXMAeGueJ1QbVBzXBDE4C` | `SIR_FOLDER_ID` |
| ISP (Instant School Plan) | `1E9RXgVeKxeITUdFw5lvyolCx6CJLEFUg` | `ISP_FOLDER_ID` |
| Building Inspection | `15dfKaAnic9VRKhp_-vFSpTr7uPk_hhKo` | `BUILDING_INSPECTION_FOLDER_ID` |

Files are matched by checking if any of the site's match terms (site title, city name, street number) appear as a case-insensitive substring in the filename. When substring matching fails, an LLM fallback (`match_file_to_site_llm()`) fuzzy-matches filenames to the site.

**PDF mime preference:** When multiple files match for a doc type, `application/pdf` is preferred over `application/vnd.google-apps.document` (Drive auto-converts PDFs to Docs; the system wants the original).

### Fallback: Site's Own Drive Folder

If a document isn't found in the shared folders, the system searches the site's root folder recursively (`list_files_recursive(folder_id, max_depth=2)`). Files are classified using a three-tier classification pipeline in `classifier.py`:

| Tier | Method | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Regex keyword matching (`classify_by_keywords`) | Free, instant |
| 2 | GPT-4o-mini on filename (`classify_by_filename_llm`) | ~$0.001/call |
| 3 | GPT-4o-mini on first-page PDF text (`classify_by_content_llm`) | ~$0.002/call |

Only escalates when the previous tier returns unknown/low confidence. Falls back to regex if OpenAI is unavailable.

### Readiness Gate

A report is only generated when all three conditions are met:

```
ready_for_report = sir_found AND isp_found AND inspection_found AND NOT report_exists
```

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1 — Receive Request (Interactive) or Trigger (Automated)

**Interactive mode:** Human provides a site name in chat. The agent begins the workflow.

**Inbox scan mode:** `scan_inbox.py` detects a new upload and triggers the pipeline for that specific site.

**Daily sweep mode:** `daily_dd_check.py` fetches all Wrike Site Records, filters to active DD stages only ("1. Looking for Sites" and "2. Evaluating Potential Sites (LOI)"), pre-fetches the three shared Drive folders once, then checks each site's readiness.

---

### Step 2 — Look Up the Wrike Site Record

**Tool:** `get_site_record(site_name_or_id)`

**Activity:**
1. Checks if input is a direct Wrike ID or permalink URL — fetches directly
2. Otherwise fetches all Site Records from Wrike space `IEAGN6I6I5RFSYZI` in batches of 100
3. Uses **GPT-5.2** to fuzzy-match the query against all record titles and addresses
4. Enriches the matched record with human-readable custom field names

**Output:** Site title, Wrike ID, address, school type, stage, Google Drive folder URL, and all custom fields.

---

### Step 3 — Check Document Availability

**Tool:** `check_site_readiness(site_name)`

**Activity:**
1. Searches shared Drive folders for SIR, ISP, and Building Inspection using site match terms
2. Falls back to recursive site folder search with three-tier classification
3. Checks if a DD report already exists
4. Returns presence booleans, file metadata, and missing doc list

**Output:** `sir_found`, `isp_found`, `inspection_found`, `report_exists`, `files` dict with `name`/`id`/`webViewLink` per doc type, `missing_docs` list.

---

### Step 3.5 — Retrieve Wrike Comments

**Tool:** `get_site_comments(site_name)`

**Activity:**
1. Fetches all comments on the Wrike site record
2. Groups comments by suggested report section (q1, q2, q3, q4, appendix, general)

**Key rule:** If Wrike comments contain team-provided cost analysis or capacity numbers, these override Building Optimizer API estimates. The team's numbers reflect real-world constraints the API doesn't capture.

---

### Step 4 — Read Source Documents

**Tool:** `read_drive_document(file_id, file_name)` — called once per document

**Activity per file:**
- **Google Docs / Sheets / Slides** — exported as plain text via Drive API
- **PDFs** — downloaded as bytes, text extracted with `pypdf` (large docs truncated to ~15,000 chars for context)
- **Plain text** — downloaded directly

**Key documents and what the agent extracts:**

| Document | Extracted Data |
|----------|---------------|
| **SIR** | Zoning, AHJ contacts, permits required, pre-app meeting, permit timeline, cost risks, schedule risks |
| **Building Inspection** | Year built, construction type, stories, SF, sprinklers, fire alarm, ADA deficiencies, egress, restrooms, scope of work, conversion risk level |
| **ISP (Program Fit Analysis)** | Room list with types/sqft, program fit score, classroom count, ADA pre-check score, optimization proposals |
| **Phase I ESA** | Environmental contamination findings, UST database results |
| **Matterport** | 3D scan link |

---

### Step 5 — Run Skill Tools

Three skill tools analyze the source data and produce structured outputs. The first two auto-publish full assessment documents to the site's Drive folder when `site_name` and `drive_folder_url` are provided.

**E-Occupancy Skill** — `apply_e_occupancy_skill(building_type_description, stories, ..., site_name, drive_folder_url)`
1. Matches building type against a scoring matrix
2. Applies height ceiling and tenant deductions
3. Returns score (0–100), zone (GREEN/YELLOW/RED), tier, and confidence
4. Publishes assessment → `sources.e_occupancy_link`

**School Approval Skill** — `apply_school_approval_skill(state, site_name, drive_folder_url)`
1. Looks up state in built-in approval table (all 50 states + DC)
2. Returns approval type, gating status, timeline, and required steps
3. Publishes assessment → `sources.school_approval_link`

**Cost Estimate** — `get_cost_estimate(total_building_sf, rooms=[...])`
1. Uses ISP room list if available; otherwise auto-generates rooms from SF
2. Calls Building Optimizer Pricing API at two finish levels
3. Returns per-tier cost estimates

---

### Step 6 — Compile and Write the DD Report

**Tool:** `create_dd_report(site_name, drive_folder_url, report_data, token_evidence=evidence)`

**Activity:**

1. **Copy template** — Copies the master Google Doc template (`DD_TEMPLATE_GOOGLE_DOC_ID`) into the site's Drive folder

2. **Normalize report_data** — `normalize_report_data()` from `report_schema.py`:
   - Flattens nested dicts to dot-separated keys
   - Injects defaults for `meta.site_name` and `meta.report_date`
   - Applies the **alias map** (26 aliases) to translate known agent key variations to canonical token names
   - Filters to only keys matching the 28 canonical template tokens
   - Returns diagnostics: replacements applied, unmatched keys, unfilled tokens, token sources

3. **Compute deltas** — Server-side computation of `exec.delta_capacity`, `exec.delta_cost`, `exec.delta_ready` from MVP/Ideal pairs

4. **Fill template** — `batchUpdate` to Docs API with `replaceAllText` per token. Link tokens (`sources.*`, `meta.drive_folder_url`) are inserted as clickable hyperlinks with display labels.

5. **Generate trace report** — Creates a companion trace document listing each token's value, source, and raw evidence excerpt. Linked via `sources.trace_link`.

**Token evidence:** As the agent reads each source document, it builds a parallel `evidence` dict recording the raw excerpt supporting each token value. This powers the trace report so reviewers can verify every field back to its source.

**Output:** Google Doc URL + diagnostics.

---

### Step 7 — Check Completeness

**Tool:** `check_report_completeness(doc_id)`

**Activity:**
1. Exports the generated Google Doc as plain text
2. Scans for two patterns:
   - `{{token}}` — a template placeholder that was never filled (hard block — do not send)
   - `[Not found — ...]` — a sourced gap label where the agent tried but data wasn't available (acceptable)

**Decision:** If any `{{token}}` hard blocks remain, the report is flagged as incomplete. If only `[Not found — ...]` labels remain, the report is ready to send.

---

### Step 8 — Send Email Notification

**Tool:** `send_dd_report_email(site_name, report_url, key_findings, additional_recipients)`

**Activity:** Sends an HTML email to configured recipients (base list + P1 Accountable person from Wrike) with the site name, key findings summary, and a link to the Google Doc report. Sent automatically — no confirmation prompt.

---

## Shared Report Pipeline

**Module:** `src/due_diligence_reporter/report_pipeline.py`

The report pipeline module contains all shared logic used by both the inbox scanner and the daily sweep:

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `TOOL_DEFINITIONS` | 11-tool schema list for Claude API calls |
| `route_tool_call()` / `route_tool_call_sync()` | Async/sync tool router mapping to server.py functions |
| `list_shared_folders_once(gc)` | Pre-fetch SIR/ISP/Inspection shared folder files |
| `match_site_in_shared_cache(terms, cache)` | Find docs for a site in pre-fetched cache |
| `check_site_readiness_direct(gc, url, terms, cache)` | Readiness check bypassing MCP layer |
| `run_dd_report_agent(site_title, prompt)` | Claude agentic loop (up to 40 iterations) |
| `process_site_pipeline(gc, title, url, terms, cache, prompt, settings)` | Full pipeline: readiness -> report -> completeness -> email |
| `post_pipeline_result(webhook_url, result, url)` | Google Chat notification per result |
| `PipelineResult` | Dataclass with status, missing_docs, doc_id, doc_url, etc. |

**Pipeline statuses:** `waiting_on_docs`, `report_exists`, `report_created`, `report_incomplete`, `generation_failed`, `error`

---

## Daily Sweep (Safety Net)

**Script:** `scripts/daily_dd_check.py`
**Schedule:** 9 AM Central, Monday-Friday (GitHub Actions cron: `0 14 * * 1-5` UTC)
**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/daily-dd-check.yml`
**Agent model:** `claude-sonnet-4-6`

**Stage filter:** Only processes sites in these Overall Site Stages:
- `1. Looking for Sites`
- `2. Evaluating Potential Sites (LOI)`

Sites in later stages (FTO in progress, FTO signed, operational) are skipped.

**Flow per site:**

```
For each Wrike Site Record in active stages with a Drive folder:
  1. Check readiness (SIR + ISP + Inspection present, no report exists)
  2. If missing docs -> post Google Chat alert listing what's missing
  3. If report exists -> skip
  4. If ready -> run Claude agent loop:
     a. get_site_record -> list_drive_documents -> read all 3 docs
     b. apply_e_occupancy_skill + apply_school_approval_skill + get_cost_estimate
     c. create_dd_report (with normalize_report_data + compute_deltas)
     d. check_report_completeness
     e. If complete -> send email to recipients
     f. If incomplete -> post Google Chat alert with unfilled tokens
```

**Optimization:** Shared folder file lists are fetched once at the start and reused for all sites, avoiding redundant API calls.

---

## Sourced Gap Labels

The bare word `[Pending]` is banned. When a field can't be filled, the agent uses a sourced gap label that names exactly what was checked:

```
[Not found — {source checked}]
```

Examples:
- `[Not found — SIR did not include AHJ contact]`
- `[Not found — ISP not yet in shared Drive folder]`
- `[Not found — Phase I ESA not in Drive folder]`
- `[Not found — building inspection did not state year built]`

This tells `check_report_completeness` and human reviewers exactly why each field is empty.

---

## What the Agent Will Not Do

- **Make lease or buy recommendations.** It presents data. The executive team decides.
- **Editorialize.** No "well below standard", "executive review recommended", or "consider before proceeding" language.
- **Override skill scores.** E-Occupancy and School Approval scores are authoritative.
- **Fabricate system IDs.** Every Wrike ID, folder ID, and document ID comes from an actual API call.
- **Leave unsourced gap labels.** Every unfilled field names the source that was checked.

---

## MatterBot Integration

**Tool:** `generate_marketing_pack(space_sid, space_name, tier, max_rooms, room_types)`
**Base URL:** `https://matterbot-1819903979408.us-central1.run.app`

Fire-and-forget call to MatterBot rendering service. Generates marketing pack images from the Matterport scan and deposits them into the site's M1 subfolder in Drive. No auth required (internal service).
